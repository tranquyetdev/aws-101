# Revoking IAM Role Temporary Credentials

To revoke **temporary credentials** for an IAM role (such as those issued by AWS Security Token Service (STS) via `AssumeRole`), you can use a combination of **IAM policies** and **AWS session management tools**. While there is no direct API to "revoke" temporary credentials that have already been issued, you can **invalidate future access** by applying restrictive policies and denying session-based permissions.

## IAM Policy for Revoking Temporary Credentials

You can create a **deny policy** that targets any session that was issued before a certain time, or one that uses specific session tags. For example, using the `aws:TokenIssueTime` condition, you can deny any actions for a session that started before a specific time.

### Example Policy: Deny Temporary Credentials Based on `aws:TokenIssueTime`

This policy revokes access to a role's temporary session if the credentials were issued before a specific time.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Action": "*",
      "Resource": "*",
      "Condition": {
        "DateLessThan": {
          "aws:TokenIssueTime": "2024-09-05T12:00:00Z"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Effect: Deny**: The policy will **deny all actions** (`Action: "*"`).
- **Condition (`DateLessThan`)**: It denies access to temporary credentials issued **before** the specified time (`"2024-09-05T12:00:00Z"`).
- **Use Case**: If you want to revoke all temporary credentials issued before a known time (e.g., when you detected a security incident), this policy ensures that those older sessions will no longer have access.

### Steps to Implement:

1. **Identify the Time**: When you want to revoke access, identify the exact time after which all issued credentials should be considered valid. Anything before that time will be revoked.
2. **Attach the Policy**: Apply this policy either to the role itself or to a broader scope, such as a bucket or service that the role interacts with.
3. **Enforce New Sessions**: After this policy is applied, users or services that attempt to use **older** temporary credentials will be denied, forcing them to obtain new credentials.

### Use Cases for Revoking Temporary Credentials:

1. **Security Breach or Incident**:

   - You suspect that temporary credentials for a role have been compromised (e.g., they were issued to an unauthorized entity or leaked).
   - Apply this policy to immediately revoke access to all temporary credentials issued before the breach.

2. **Role Change or Policy Update**:

   - You modify a roleâ€™s policies or privileges and need to ensure that no old sessions continue to operate with outdated or invalid permissions.
   - This policy ensures that the previously issued credentials do not continue to access resources with the outdated permissions.

3. **Termination or Access Revocation**:

   - A team member or application has completed its task or been terminated, and you need to revoke access immediately.
   - Rather than waiting for temporary credentials to expire (which could last for up to 12 hours), you can revoke access immediately using the `aws:TokenIssueTime` condition.

4. **Rotating Credentials**:
   - You may need to force all sessions to be invalidated during periodic security maintenance, such as rotating IAM roles and permissions.
   - By setting a cut-off time, you ensure that all credentials prior to the time of rotation are invalidated.

### Conclusion:

Although you cannot directly revoke temporary credentials once they are issued, you can use IAM policies with conditions like `aws:TokenIssueTime` to **deny access to sessions** that were created before a certain time. This is useful for handling security incidents, role changes, or revoking access in a time-sensitive manner.
